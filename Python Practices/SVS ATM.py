    In this program you will be able to see an ATM console program.
    This will have different options in order for you to do your business
    
    I decided to practice different topics with this program:
        Functions
        Conditionals
        Exceptions, so on

    I will add other options that we could be able to do in an ATM machine
    That would be in future versions
